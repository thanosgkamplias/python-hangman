# Hangman Game

A simple, text-based version of the classic Hangman game written in Python. I built this project to practice core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and input validation.

## Features
* **Cross-platform:** The game automatically clears the screen on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Input handling:** It checks if inputs are valid letters and prevents penalty for repeated guesses.
* **Visuals:** Includes ASCII art for the hangman stages.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thanosgkamplias/python-hangman.git

2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd python-hangman

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python hangman_main.py

## Files
- **hangman_main.py:** Contains the main game logic.
- **hangman_art.py:** Holds the ASCII art assets.
- **hangman_words.py:** The list of words for the game.
